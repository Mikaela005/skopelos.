<h1 style="border: 14px solid LightSteelBlue;">Skopelos one of the most beautiful islands</h1>
<BR>
<p style="color:DarkTurquoise;"> Skópelos belongs to the North Sporades group of islands and has three main ports: Skópelos, Agnóntas and Glóssa.
Hóra, on the northern coast, is the capital of the island. Its ancient name was Peparithos, after the son of the god Dionysos and Ariadne, who was the first inhabitant of the island.
Hóra nestles comfortably on a hill and sprawls around a castle. The medieval castle with its sweeping views of the Aegean, the stone houses with picture-perfect courtyards, narrow paved streets and a number of Byzantine churches, the town encapsulates the essence of a typical Greek island settlement. Take a trip through the rich history of the island with a visit to the Folklore Museum, housed in a renovated mansion built in the previous century, where you can enjoy a rich collection of folklore-related exhibits (open Mon-Sat, 10:00-14:00 & 19:00-22:00; entrance: €3).</p>
